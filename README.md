# Grocery Cart Application  :shopping_cart:


### Welcome to my Grocery Cart Application!

This is a personal side project developed using Swift for iOS. 

The app allows users to:

- **Create a Grocery List**: Add items you want to buy into a simple and intuitive list interface.
- **Record Purchase History**: Once you finish shopping, the application records your purchased items in a history list for future reference.
- **Manage Your List**: Easily view and edit your grocery list and history.

## Key Features

- **Add and Remove Items**: Seamlessly add items to your cart and remove them as needed.
- **View Purchase History**: Access a detailed history of your past grocery lists and purchases.
- **Clear All History**: Quickly clear all recorded history with a dedicated button placed conveniently in the history view.

## Upcoming Features

I plan to enhance the application with additional features in future updates, including:

- **Item Categories**: Organize your grocery items into categories for better management.
- **Price Tracking**: Keep track of item prices and view total costs.
- **Shopping Lists Sharing**: Share your grocery lists with others for collaborative shopping.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to improve and expand the functionality of the app.

## Technologies Used

- **Swift**: For the core development of the iOS application.
- **SwiftUI**: For building the user interface and handling interactions.
